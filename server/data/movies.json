By the time the piece is performed, her presence in his life is an absolute necessity. Her deep understanding of his work is such that she even corrects mistakes he has made, while her passionate personality opens a door into his private world.",

At first, Luke tries all his old tricks upon Sam. But instead of getting angry, Sam seems to actually understand.",
